# CubeSolvingBot
## Overview
This project implemnts Kociemba's [RubiksCube-TwophaseSolver]. A widely used algorithm for those who wish to solve a rubiks cube as efficiently as possible. 
In this version I provide the CAD files I created to build a Rubik's Cube solving robot. I will also provide the code 
that accompanies it that will take a scrambled rubiks cube and solve it.

## Usage
*Under Construction more to come very soon!*
