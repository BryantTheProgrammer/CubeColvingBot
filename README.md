# CubeSolvingBot
## Overview
This project implemnts Kociemba's [RubiksCube-TwophaseSolver]. A widely used algorithm for those who wish to solve a rubiks cube as efficiently as possible. 
In this version, I provide the CAD files I created to build a Rubik's Cube-solving robot. I will also provide the code 
that accompanies it that will take a scrambled rubiks cube and solve it.

## Guide to Build
As part of this project, I want to provide as much information about what I learned as possible for anyone interested in building this project or building a project with similar applications. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xN_PJmTus-j4ZlNDsJeUDBoS-nGAd1Cgn9l0OXvKc6M/edit?usp=sharing) you should find my notes(Under Construction) for all the aspects of this project starting with a Bill of Materials and going all the way to the finished bot. 

If you have any questions while I'm finishing up the documentation, feel free to message/email me.

*Under Construction, more to come this fall as the project picks back up!*
